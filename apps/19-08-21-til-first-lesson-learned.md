I have tried to learn for really long time without much of a success. I tried different techniques, different tools and none seemed to work..

Now it looks finally I found a tool, that would be just right for me and my colleagues! It is unbelieveable!

The applicaiton is called [Geeks-Diary](https://github.com/seokju-na/geeks-diary)
